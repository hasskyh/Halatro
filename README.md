# Halatro
## Description
This is a simple game based on Balatro, where you can either play the game yourself or let an AI play it for you.
There are multiple AI built into the program, but they can only be swapped out by setting myAI to be equal to one of them in the CourseworkOne.hs file.
## Installation
To install, simply clone the directory. You will also need to make sure you have Haskell installed on your computer. You can then use stack run to play yourself, or stack run ai to get myAI to play it for you instead. You can also do stack run total ___ (stack run total 1000 for instance) to get the ai to play that many times, and then return the average score.
